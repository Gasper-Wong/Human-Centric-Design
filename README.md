# Human-Centric-Design  

## Business Problem  
How might we improve the experience of selecting a mobile plan & upgrading a device while ensuring transparency & maximizing value?  
We have catered our solution to Singtel for the purposes of the group project. We have applied HCD concepts throughout this project to understand user needs and implement solution that fulfills those needs.  
Note: Scenario is merely hypothetical and Singtel has not approached us for the solution.  

## Solution and Application of HCD
